## What is future money?

When most think about budgetting they get distracted with where their money went. This is not helpful.

Future money has two primary rules:
1. Do not spend money meant for the future.
2. Do not worry about money spent in the past.

This allows you to do things like:

- Complete your monthly budget in 15 minutes.
- Reduce stress since you are only concerns with the present and future.
- Use the same layout for both *your plan* and *cash flow*.
