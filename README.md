# Future money

Open-source budget software designed for future money.

## What is future money?

When most think about budgeting they get distracted with where their money went. This is not helpful.

Future money has two primary rules:
1. Do not spend money meant for the future.
2. Do not worry about money spent in the past.

This allows us to promise you:

- A greatly simplified budget plan.
- Complete your monthly budget as quickly as 5-15 minutes. Plan your financial year in an hour.
- Reduce your financial stress.
- Use the same layout for both *your plan* and *cash flow*.

## Origin story

Originally, I wanted a budget to help me manage the complexities of life. So, I did what 
most people do, I made a spreadsheet. For the last twenty years, I've improved and tweaked 
the spreadsheet but the essence has remained the same: *budgeting simplicity*.
